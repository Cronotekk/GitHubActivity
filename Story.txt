There once was a man named Tom who wanted to climb every mountain in the world. He decided to start big
with Mount Everest. After months of practice and months of climbing he eventually made it to the top. He
gradually climbed smaller and smaller mountains until he was scaling every small hill in Wisconsin. Then one day
on one of his rotuine hikes he met another man, Jim, who was doing the same thing.

"I thought I was the only one climbing all the mountains in this tall-to-small order!", Tom exclaimed. But Jim
assured him that his method of exploration was not unique or special. For Tom, this was an extremely unwelcome
development. The only reason he was doing this was to hopefully get his name printed in the local newspaper in
celebration of his achievement, and that would be much less likely to happen if someone else matched his feat.
"This is unacceptable," said Tom. "I demand that we hold a competition, and the loser must agree to stop 
climbing up parts of the Earth's surface that are higher up than the surrounding parts." Jim agreed to the
challenge and assumed that the contest would be somehow related to mountain climbing, but Tom had other ideas.
