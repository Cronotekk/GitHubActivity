There once was a man named Tom who wanted to climb every mountain in the world. He decided to start big
with Mount Everest. After months of practice and months of climbing he eventually made it to the top. He
gradually climbed smaller and smaller mountains until he was scaling every small hill in Wisconsin. Then one day
on one of his rotuine hikes he met another man, Jim, who was doing the same thing.
